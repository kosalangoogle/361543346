# This file is used by the spectacles code linter to indicate which rules shall be applied and which directories shall be linted. 
# You can find a detailed description of the rules here: https://deploy-preview-132--affectionate-shaw-852a45.netlify.app/app/reference/style-validator-rules/
# The general documentation of the spectacles linter can be found here: https://docs.spectacles.dev/app/tutorials/validators/#the-style-validator
# This is a list of fundamental rules that should always be complied with and should stritly be enforced through a hard CI check.

# Due to the characteristics of auto-generated views (from tables), some rules will not be complied with. 
# The relevant amendments (e.g. adding a primary key, adding a complete set of descriptions) will instead live in refinement folders.

# Here we define a set of custom rules that are specific to the Epidemic Sound Looker Project
custom_rules:
  - title: Explore label does not start with exactly one of the following emojis [✅⚠⛔️]
    code: CE100
    rationale: Emojis act as flags to indicate to users whether the data is trustworthy to avoid business decisions being made based on faulty data. They should always be included at the beginning of the explore label.
    select:
      - explore.label
    regex: ^(✅|⚠️|⛔️)(?!.*(✅|⚠️|⛔️))
    negative: false
    type: PatternMatchRule
  - title: Explore does not have a description
    code: CE101
    rationale: Allow both users as well as developer understand the purpose of the explore. This applies to both hidden and visible explores.
    select:
    - explore
    criteria:
    - type: ParameterFilter
      parameter_name: description
    negative: false
    type: ParameterRule
  - title: Explore group_label is not one of 'Central Teams', 'DRM', 'Growth', 'Main', 'Partnerships', 'Partnerships & DRM', 'Sound', 'Soundtrack', 'Tech & Tools', 'Commercial', 'Product'
    code: CE102
    rationale: The label needs to clearly state the ownership of a specific explore for maintenance purposes.
    select:
    - explore.group_label
    regex: ^(?:Soundtrack|Growth|Main|Tech & Tools|Sound|Partnerships & DRM|DRM|Partnerships|Central Teams|Commercial|Product)$
    negative: false
    type: PatternMatchRule
  - title: Explore does not have a group_label
    code: CE103
    rationale: A group_label is used to determine the ownership of a specific explore for maintenance purposes
    select:
    - explore
    criteria:
    - type: ParameterFilter
      parameter_name: group_label
    negative: false
    type: ParameterRule
